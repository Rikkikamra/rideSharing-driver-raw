// This file simply reâ€‘exports the screen implementation from
// `frontend/screens/RideTypeSelection.js`.  The project previously
// contained two separate implementations of ride type selection,
// resulting in duplicate screens.  Consolidating here ensures
// consistency and prevents duplication.
